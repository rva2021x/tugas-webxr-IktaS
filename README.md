# Pong!
# Casual game for the bored.

This game is played only with Oculus Device. Either Quest or Quest 2. 

Because aframe-physics-system does not support CCD ( Continous Collision Detection ), the ball sometimes ( well, more than sometimes ) passes through
the racket on high speed or when moving the racket at high speed. Be careful of that.
